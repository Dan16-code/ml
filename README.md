This project contains Node localiztion in wireless sensor network using machine learning
`Although global navigation satellite systems (GNSS)-based location services are widely used, they have limitations in closed or indoor areas where direct line-of-sight is unavailable. Therefore, alternative wireless technologies are required to provide accurate indoor positioning. Wi-Fi-based positioning has become popular, as Wi-Fi communication is widespread in indoor environments. Received signal strength indication (RSSI) estimates the position of a user based on signals received from several access points. In this project, machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, KNN, and SVM are used to estimate the user's location accurately in an indoor environment.
